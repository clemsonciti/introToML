Welcome to Clemson University's Cyberinfrastructure and Technology Integration Training Workshops!

Introduction to Machine Learning Techniques and Tools 

--The first half of this workshop focuses on machine learning techniques in Python (Scikit-learn), which remains the overwhelming first choice as a programming language for machine learning. Part of the code is from https://github.com/amueller/scipy-2016-sklearn.
--The second half of workshop focused on deep learning techniques in DIGITS, the NVIDIA Deep Learning GPU Training System, which is easy to learn and use. 
-- We will also learn how to process through the Palmetto Supercomputer.
